    "### What is Textacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "[textacy](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) is a text pre/post-processing framework that will help make many of the tasks we performed in this course significantly easier. As its [Github description](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) states:\n",
    "> textacy is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library, textacy focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `spacy` focuses on tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, etc., `textacy` focuses on all the different tasks that come before and after."
