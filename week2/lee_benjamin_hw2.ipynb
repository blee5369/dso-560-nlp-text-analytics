    "    1. Removing punctuation\n",
    "    2. Lemmetizing using part of speech\n",

    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleveland showed high mentions in all three fields, meaning it could do better with some actions to improve. However, New York showed a high increase in mention ratio in facilty. This shows that many  McDonalds customers in New York shows dissatisfaction regarding their facilties. We can also infer that Portland has a problem with burger quality due to its huge spike in proportion of reviews mentioning burgers. \n",
