    "A. Using the **McDonalds Yelp Review CSV file**, **process the reviews**.\n",
    "This means you should think briefly about:\n",
    "* what stopwords to remove (should you add any custom stopwords to the set? Remove any stopwords?)\n",
    "* what regex cleaning you may need to perform (for example, are there different ways of saying `hamburger` that you need to account for?)\n",
    "* stemming/lemmatization (explain in your notebook why you used stemming versus lemmatization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **count-vectorize the dataset**. Use the **`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`** examples from `Linear Algebra, Distance and Similarity (Completed).ipynb` and `Text Preprocessing Techniques (Completed).ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not want redundant features - for instance, I do not want `hamburgers` and `hamburger` to be two distinct columns in your document-term matrix. Therefore, I'll be taking a look to make sure you've properly performed your cleaning, stopword removal, etc. to reduce the number of dimensions in your dataset. "

There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window.  I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers. \n",

They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. I could not recommend this location any less. If you can wait, take a pass. There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA. \n",
